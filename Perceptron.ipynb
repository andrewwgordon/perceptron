        "## Biological Neurons\n",
        "I'm not planning to go in-depth on the biological neuron, but it's key to understanding where Neural Networks have come from to have a basic appreciation of a neuron.\n",

        "The concept of a neuron was first proposed in the mid 19th century by a number of scientists. However, the major breakthrough came in 1891 by the German sciemtist [Wilhelm Waldeyer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinrich_Wilhelm_Gottfried_von_Waldeyer-Hartz). For a good entry introduction to Neurons I recommend [this article](https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology/human-biology/neuron-nervous-system/a/overview-of-neuron-structure-and-function) on Khanacademy.It was understood early on that Neurons are the information processing backbone of biological systems. Essentially, a neuron has three basic functions:\n",
        "- Receive signals (information)\n",
        "- Integrate these received signals and determine what information should be passed on\n",
        "- Send the integrated and procesed information on as signals to connected neurons\n",
        "\n",
        "## Artificial Neurons\n",
        "It will be obvious to any Computer Scientist or Software Engineer that the description of a biological neuron is analogeous to a generalised information processing function.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the 1940's, this analogy is exactly what [Warren McCullock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Sturgis_McCulloch) and [Walter Pitts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Pitts) outlined their seminal paper [A Logical Calculus of the Ideas Immanent in Nervous Activity](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~./epxing/Class/10715/reading/McCulloch.and.Pitts.pdf). This paper is the foundation for all the work in Neural Networks and Deep Learning that has been developed since.\n",
        "\n",
        "An Artificial Neuron can be simply stated as a mathematical function that takes a series of inputs, computes a function on these inputs that generates an output.\n",
        "## Perceptron\n",
        "McCullock and Pitts work was further developed in the 1950s by [Frank Rosenblatt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Rosenblatt) who was a Research Psychologist and Project Engineer at the Cornell Aeronautical Laboratory. Rosenblatts work culmulated in the first Neural Network implementation on an [IBM 704](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_704). Rosenblatt described his system Perceptron. You can read his 1958 paper [here](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.335.3398&rep=rep1&type=pdf). \n",
